## A cooperative society platform.
In Uganda there are very many cooperative societies. Many groups of people, due to poverty, are making these groups in their various sectors, fields and professions so that they can make ends meet. In most cases
the leaders in these groups mismanage their resources and the cooperative societies at times lack market for their products.

My aim is to make a platform that will do the following. 
___
* Enable cooperatives mange their resources efficiently, seek funding and find market for their products as fast as possible and get feedback from their customers.
* This platform will also enable people to perform transactions, process loans and also keep track of their progress.
___
